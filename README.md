**GeomExp (Geometric Explanations)** is the collection of scripts used for the
experiments in my Bachelor's thesis: 
> Explaining DNN Based Facial Expression Classifications

in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science
Artificial Intelligence.

The scripts are split for the DNN experiments and the CNN experiments. Each script 
contains the functions used for a certain part of the experiment.
